# Coding-1-Final
*Coding Final 1 website is a get to know more about me part 2. In one of the websites that you made us do for our project, I made a get-to-know-me and my family. Well, this time the website is only about me. Here you will get to read more about my true thoughts. As you can see on the home page, the three pictures on the slides are Paris, Canada, and Korea. These are the places that I would love to visit in the future. The about page gives more details on what's going on in my life. Lastly, the contacts page, gives information on how you will be able to contact me. There are multiple ways to do so, whether via facebook, phone, instagram and many more.

*My website:

*I made a footer that shows the link of the website, the sports I play, and the places I want to go to.

*In the about page, I made a two column section to separate the image to the text.

*In the contacts page, I made a table for the list of contacts.

*I added social media icons.
