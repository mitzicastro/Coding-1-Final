# Coding-1-Final
Coding Final 1 website is a get to know more about me part 2. In one of the websites that you made us do for our project, I made a get to know me and my family. Well this time the website is only about me. Here you will get to read more about my true thoughts. As you can see at the home page, the three pictures on the slides are Paris, Canada, and Korea. These are the places that I would love to visit in the future.
