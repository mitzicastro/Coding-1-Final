			<p class="text">I am a sophomore at Madison Academic Magnet High School. I play volleyball and tennis for the school for two years now and I am proud to say that I play varsity.
        I plan to work hard to earn my spot and continue on playing these sports for the rest of high school. Madison Academic High School has been a really challenging school 
        for me not only in academics but also in sports. This may be the case but I still love how I have to work hard in order to maintain my grades to be able to continue playing
        sports.

			<p class="text">Recently I have changed my passion more into tennis than volleyball. Even though I have played volleyball for about 8 years now, I am starting to lose my interest in playing
        it. It is still fun but when I got to high school all I felt was competitiveness, not from the school that we're going up against but from my own teammates. With tennis, there 
        are doubles but there is singles which you play individually. In this sport atleast I get to chose whether I want to work with a partner or just rely on myself.

        <p class="text">I have been struggling through all these years thinking about which career path I would want
          to take in the near future. With the help of taking coding class I have now narrowed it down into one choice. Before taking coding class, I was thinking
          about whether being a nurse or an IT for my career in the future, and although for me coding class seems amazing especially when you see the outcome of your hardwork. I'm afraid
          that this is not what I want. I have decided to become a travel nurse. When I was little traveling was a very uncommon thing for us to do since, we didn't have enough money to do so.
          I would listen to my classmates talk about their trips during the summer while I just stayed at home and binge watch all the shows I could. Thinking about the future,
          two things that could make me really happy would be being able to travel around the world whilst helping other people.
